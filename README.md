Qlik Sense extension for field and variable selections.

This extension is an "all in one" selection component.
- create selectors for fields
- supports select only one and default selection
- will fit on one line - you can disable Qlik Sense default header and do other tricks to enhance standard visualization
- renders as a list, button row or drop down
- can set variable value from predefined list or via date picker
 - two variables can be set at the same selection (if you need a value for UI and value for other usage)
- mobile zoom effect can be disabled. No need for three clicks if you want to select something. Only one is enough
- several posibilities for visual changes like colors, borders etc

Will be done later:
- source code will be cleaned
- more visualization parameters added
